## How to play Euchre, with links and pictures ##

Oh no, I chose a first coding project as a card game that is far from universally known. If you’ve never played Euchre before read below. Ok, here goes. [inhales]

Euchre Setup:

We use the 9 and up cards out a regular deck of cards, so no 2–8 cards (aces are high). Once you have the Euchre deck ready you need 4 players, pick a person and sit across from them, their your partner now!

**Euchre play:**

Each round of play we each get 5 cards and we choose a suit to be the _special suit _that beats all others. 

Once the special suit is chosen—by the way it’s known as, all politics aside, as “Trump”—[cough] now we play a “Trick” aka “go around the table playing one card and hoping our card is the highest”. 

The first card played is the “lead” (like leader) and the other players must follow that card’s suit if they can. If the other player can’t follow that suit then they can play a different suit, maybe even trump (the highest winningest suit) and take the trick!

Whomever won the first trick gets to lead the next trick. Here’s how you get points, get as many tricks as you can.  

Are you getting this? I hope you’re getting this, but if you’re ever struggling there’s a great video if you scroll down the page here.

**Scoring and special trump things:**

Scoring? If your team chose Trump (the winningest suit) and you lose 3 or more tricks, then the other team gets 2 points, and this is called a “Euchre”! Otherwise if you win 3 or 4 tricks your team gets a point, if you win all 5 tricks your team gets 2 points. First team to 10 (or more) wins. 

Special Trump stuff? Yep, the trump suit pulls over the Jack from the other suit of the same color. The order of highest to lowest of trump goes Jack, other Jack, Ace and down to the 9. This image shows the ranking order if clubs was trump.

Ok, are you lost yet? I know it’s odd but it’s part of the game’s charm. 

**The Process to pick trump**

Alright, from the top! The person holding the deck of 24 cards the first round is the dealer they do 2 passes around the table in a pattern that yields 5 cards for each person. 

The 4 cards remaining go face down near the dealer, the dealer then flips the top card up. This is the maybe-trump-is-this-suit card!

The person left of the dealer will look at their hand and say whether or not they’d like that card’s suit to be the bestest suit. If so, then the dealer takes that cards and adds it to their hand, then discards. If not, then the next person makes the same Yay or Nay call. 

If it gets to the dealer and even they “Pass” on picking up the maybe-trump-is-this-suit card, then the dealer flips that card over. Starting with the person left of the dealer again that person can pick any of the three other suits that was not offered by the previous option OR that person can also pass. This goes around the table clockwise as players pass.  If everyone passes and it goes to the dealer again then the dealer can not pass and must pick Trump. 

Once Trump is chosen the person left of the dealer plays the first card! Then it plays as paragraph 3 says in Euchre play above.

**Closing thoughts**

Wahoo! That’s Euchre, or at least one of the many versions of Euchre, it’s regionally specific where even separate towns play with some fun rule additions. There’s even a high level of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cheating and stealing </span>baked into this past time—where I’m from at least. There’s no cheating possibilities built into my code but that might be an expansion!

My coded version doesn’t yet have visuals to it so to make things easier the game can be played in browser here, enjoy!

**Fun terms:**

The Kitty: The remainder 4 cards left after dealing out 5 to each player

Farmer’s hand: A hand of all 9s and 10s, in some versions of play one could call “farmer’s hand” and trade 4 cards out with the kitty, other versions when it’s called the cards are shuffled and redealt. 

Screw the dealer: This is a rule played in this game where the dealer has to choose if it comes to them after the card flip. Other versions just move to the next dealer and redeal the cards. 

Going alone: This variation is used when a player has a strong hand and they can opt to “go alone” and perhaps win more points by doing so

Bower: The name of the Jack’s of trump. The “right” bower is of the suit of trump while the “left” bower is the off suit Jack.
