# Euchre With CPU Opponents

A challenge project in Python to bring a Michigan/Midwestern card game into digital form. This game calls for 4 players so optional CPU players can fill in any empty chairs.  


# Demo

Not yet available as code is still in progress


# Motivation

Part of my long journey in pursuing a role in Data Consulting, this project is my first non-tutorial python based project where I’m writing each block of code. This is to solidify my understanding and usage recall of what I’ve learned in the course (below), which means I did not reference another creator’s enactment of Euchre.

Course: 

Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3 

Taught by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science, Pierian Data Inc.

I have previously taken a course Intro to Programming with Python so I’m pleased to be returning after my fun with Processing (a Java environment) and P5JS (a JavaScript environment). 


# Build Status

In Progress

EuchreInProgress.py is the file I'm currently working in


# Built with 

Language: Python

Editor: Jupyter Notebook at first, transistioned to Visual Studio Code for the last half


# Features

Optionals 1-4 CPU players

Logic gates 

Object Oriented Programming

Use of built in functions

Purposeful Error handling

Gameplay Features:

Playing Table is filled with requested players human or CPU

Two stages of Special Suit (aka "Trump) selection, the first of major component of the game

still to come:

Playing out hands laying cards on the table  

score keeping


# Installation 

I run this through Jupyter Notebook. I obtained Jupyter through Anaconda Navigator [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), or Jupyter can be downloaded separately [here](https://jupyter.org/install). Jupyter can save files as .py instead of .ipynb so I should have a .py version of this in my repository for ease of viewing. 


# How to Use

All through filling prompted inputs, commonly a letter for a word like “c” for “clubs” or a number like “2” for the second card listed. Knowing how to play Euchre will help in understanding what’s happening gamewise but worst case one might lose some points, there’s error checking and logic that prevents playing an incorrect card so input away! 


# Credits

I’m very thankful to StackOverFlow and intend to contribute there now that I’ve made a profile! There were many times I referenced that site for examples of what built in functions, in line prints, and variable references for dictionaries and lists. 

GitHub is immensely wonderful and I intend to participate in open source projects. 

I made quite a few trips over to TheCodingTrain on youtube. Not only is Daniel Shiffman an inspiring programming enthusiast but his videos give excellent explanations of framework interactions like the very push and pull commands for this READme!
