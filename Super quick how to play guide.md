## Super quick version of how to play Euchre ##

Staging



*   2, 2 person teams
*   Deck is only 9s and up, including Aces
*   partners sit across from each other
*   Deal five cards to everyone
*   Flip the top card up from the remainder of cards

Deciding Special Suit



1. Going clockwise from dealer decide if that card’s suit is the Special suit (aka Trump) or not
2. if anyone says “yes” the dealer picks that card up and discards one
3. If everyone passes that card is flipped face down and now we go around again asking what should be the Special Suit of the 3 possible other suits, can’t choose the flipped over card’s suit
4. if no one again chooses a Special Suit then the dealer has to make that decision, if anyone says “yes” to a suit then that suit is the Special Suit
5. The special suit is the highest ranked suit, the special suit steals the jack from the suit of the same color. 
*   The special suits ordering goes Jack, other same color Jack, Ace and down to 9 

Play



1. The person to the left of dealer goes first and lays down a card
2. going clockwise everyone lays a card and follows the first card’s suit if they can
3. if they don’t have that suit then they can play any card they want
4. Once all 4 players play a card that turn is over and the player that played the highest ranked card wins, play then starts the next hand or “trick”, and the play goes around from there. 
5. Repeat until all 5 tricks are played
6. Team with the most tricks gets points
7. Dealer is now person one clockwise of who was first dealer

Scoring
